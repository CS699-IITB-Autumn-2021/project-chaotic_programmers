### Problem Statement

Flash cards are used as a self-testing technique and the efficacy is determined by the amount and timings of practice. The pandemic has affected academic delivery and collaborative learning. A tool for revision and sharing flashcards can enhance the learning process and a leaderboard provides a virtual competitive environment and enhances learnerâ€™s motivation.

### Motivation

Building a website to create a study tool which uses flashcards and timed revisions for learners and help them cope up with online education by providing a competitive feel with their friends along with sharing their flashcards to give them feel of a virtual group study environment.
